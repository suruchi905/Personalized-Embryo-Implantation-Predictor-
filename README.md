# Personalized Embryo Implantation Predictor

This project predicts the probability of embryo implantation using
machine learning on a synthetic IVF dataset.

## Problem Statement
To assist clinical decision-making by predicting embryo implantation
success based on patient-specific IVF parameters.

## Dataset
- Synthetic IVF dataset generated to preserve patient privacy
- Features include age, AMH level, endometrium thickness,
  embryo quality, and previous IVF failures

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask / Streamlit

## Project Workflow
1. Synthetic data generation
2. Feature engineering
3. ML model training & evaluation
4. Streamlit Web application for prediction
